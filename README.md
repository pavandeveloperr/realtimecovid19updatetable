# REAL TIME COVID19 UPDATE TABLE
There are many sources to getting the realtime cases data about this, but you can also create your own using a third-party API. Many types of API available in GitHub to create your own update program, some are comes with 3D globe but this is the basic one.  

Basically, there is a table with 4 columns for country names, total cases, deaths, and recovered.
Also at the top, you will see the total count of cases, deaths, and recovered peoples over the world. And there is sort by program available, you can sort by most cases, most recovered, and most deaths also, you can search specific country. 

So,I am sharing COVID 19 Realtime Update Table With Sort and Search features. There I have used HTML to create the structure or layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for getting and showing data over API. 
This program is fully dynamic and responsive in design. You can use this program to create your own live coronavirus update website or placing in your existing website.
Stay safe & Stay Home ...Happy Coding :)
